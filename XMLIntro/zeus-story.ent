  Carved from ivory, on a throne of cedarwood, the statue was created by the Greek sculptor Phidias around 430 BC.  In its right hand was a life-size statue of Nike, the goddess of victory, and in its left was a large sceptre topped with an eagle.  The statue, nearly 40 feet tall, was said to fill the entire width of the one of the aisles of the Temple of Zeus, and its head nearly scraped the temple's ceiling.<para/>In 426 AD, the temple was destroyed and many historians believe that the statue was destroyed at that time. Others believe, however, that the statue was moved to Constantinople (now Istanbul) and was destroyed about 50 years later.<para/>Although many copies of the statue were made during its 800+ year lifespan, none are known to have survived.
