An XML document is considered well-formed if it satisfies these rules:
The XML document must contain exactly one root element, which contains all the other elements in the document.
Every element must have a closing tag.
Elements must be properly nested.
XML is case-sensitive.
An attribute's value must always be enclosed in quotation marks, single or double.
Element and attribute names must begin with a letter, underscore, or colon; names beginning with "xml" (in any case) are reserved and cannot be used
